Video player made with WPF using the VLC player as a base for it's layout. 

Most of the functionalities are still in development, but the basic functionalities of play, pause, stop and file search are already implemented.

This project is being made as a way to learn more about WPF and C#, and also as a way to have a custom video player for personal use and inspiration for future projects.

I'm always open to suggestions and contributions.
